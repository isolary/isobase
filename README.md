# Isobase

_An extendable starter design/development system aimed at starting with the basics + a few common components._

1. Isobase is heavily inspired by Ether (by we the scenery). Ether is an opinionated design system that is built with typography at itâ€™s core. Sizes and spacing are derived mathematically from the schematics of the typeface itself. We will build on these core principles for extending Isobase. [More on Ether](https://ether.thescenery.co/)

2. Isobase is meant to be extendable/configurable.

- Can alternatively use 8px grid
- Can be extended to included react components
- Can utilize 3rd party libraries

3. Isobase is meant to build design systems with code as the source of truth.

- Can be exported to a sketch file via [html-sketchapp-cli](https://github.com/seek-oss/html-sketchapp-cli) and [html-sketchapp](https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp)
